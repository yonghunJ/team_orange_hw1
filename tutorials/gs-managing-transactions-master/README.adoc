This guide walks you through the process of wrapping database operations with non-intrusive transactions.

== What you'll build

You'll build a simple JDBC application wherein you make database operations transactional without having to write http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/transactions.html#commit_transactions[specialized JDBC code].


== What you'll need

:java_version: 1.8

== Create a booking service
First, use the `BookingService` class to create a JDBC-based service that books people into the system by name.

`src/main/java/hello/BookingService.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/BookingService.java[]
----

The code has an autowired `JdbcTemplate`, a handy template class that does all the database interactions needed by the code below.

You also have a `book` method aimed at booking multiple people. It loops through the list of people, and for each person, inserts them into the `BOOKINGS` table using the `JdbcTemplate`. This method is tagged with `@Transactional`, meaning that any failure causes the entire operation to roll back to its previous state, and to re-throw the original exception. This means that none of the people will be added to `BOOKINGS` if one person fails to be added.

You also have a `findAllBookings` method to query the database. Each row fetched from the database is converted into a `String` and then assembled into a `List`.

== Build an application
`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application.adoc[]

Your application has actually zero configuration. Spring Boot will detect `spring-jdbc` on the classpath and `h2` and will create a `DataSource` and a `JdbcTemplate` for you automatically. Because such infrastructure is now available and you have no dedicated configuration, a `DataSourceTransactionManager` will also be created for you: this is the component that intercepts the `@Transactional` annotated method (e.g. the `book` on `BookingService`). The `BookingService` is detected via classpath scanning.

Another Spring Boot feature demonstrated in this guide is http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-initialize-a-database-using-spring-jdbc[the ability to initialize the schema on startup]:

`src/main/resources/schema.sql`
[source,sql]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/schema.sql[]
----

There is also a {runner}[`CommandLineRunner`] that injects the `BookingService` and showcases various transactional use cases.

`src/main/java/hello/AppRunner.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/AppRunner.java[]

You should see the following output:

....

The `BOOKINGS` table has two constraints on the **first_name** column:

- Names cannot be longer than five characters.
- Names cannot be null.

The first three names inserted are **Alice**, **Bob**, and **Carol**. The application asserts that three people were added to that table. If that had not worked, the application would have exited early.

Next, another booking is done for **Chris** and **Samuel**. Samuel's name is deliberately too long, forcing an insert error. Transactional behavior stipulates that both Chris and Samuel; that is, this transaction, should be rolled back. Thus there should still be only three people in that table, which the assertion demonstrates.

Finally, **Buddy** and **null** are booked. As the output shows, null causes a rollback as well, leaving the same three people booked.

== Summary
Congratulations! You've just used Spring to develop a simple JDBC application wrapped with non-intrusive transactions.
